I was curious about which places in the United States were both really sunny and really inexpensive. It's fine to live in Detroit from a cost stand point, but the weather is terrible. Similarly, Hawaii is probably beautiful, but surly expensive.

I gathered some data on [days of sun per year for most cities, and also price index data.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z-3S2iXg_2qMn20MyDv9pmpCc-bnwbqpYPIHKurkZRc/pubhtml?gid=1742673019&single=true) Plotting using each data set for the X and Y axes respectively yields a helpful chart for exploring, where one might want to live:

The results aren't too surprising, Vegas is certainly a great spot, as is LA, Oklahoma City, and Phoenix. I hope this helps any of you sun birds looking for a place to live.
