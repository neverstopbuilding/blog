One thing that came up while on the Dominican Republic trip was my
productivity and email tactics; it may have started with my scolding of
fellow co-workers who were checking their blackberries while in a
tropical paradise.

And so I thought it would be worth detailing the practices as they stand
now, so I can examine them for improvements and share what I have so far
with others who might benefit. This post should serve as a high level
overview of the different ways I manage my tasks and communication. I’ll
go into more detail which various sections in future posts.

##What I Do
First it might be worth noting that these strategies might not apply to
all types of work. I am a software engineer / product manager / team
leader / start-up founder. Much of my work can be done asynchronously.
But I believe all work can be done asynchronously, and that unless lives
are on the line, the guy/gal on the other end of the line, email, sale,
transaction, tweet, blog, etc… can wait.

OK so what I do involves:

-   My day job at Hobsons as a software engineer and team lead for a
    Romanian development outfit.
-   LoyalCurve, a customer loyalty mobile app start up.
-   Some freelance projects, and an array of events, goals, and projects
    that I’d like to explore; basically: “personal life stuff.”

##How I Do It

Here is how I manage the broad categories:



###Day Job
First: Set your answering machine like this:

> “Hi, I’m unavailable right now, but if you leave a message I’ll get
> back to you; if you send me an email at … I can generally get back to
> you much sooner.”

I’m not sure if I have even done this, but rest assured I can never be
reached by phone at the office. If people want to reach me, they email
me, and then I get back to them when I see fit.


*Managing Email:* Because I have to use Outlook (barf) I developed a
process to deal with it like out look, which I detail in [this post][].

-   Most mail is caught by a rule, and sent right to
    an *archive *folder, this gets rid of Jira, Jive, Confluence,
    newsletters, group emails and anything else that no one reads.
-   Other rules highlight mail sent to me and only me, or mail that
    comes from a list of “bosses.”
-   All mail is auto-read by another rule.
-   All notifications are turned off, this combined with the previous
    tip let only me decide when email distracts me.
-   A few times a day I use the custom archive feature to clean out my
    inbox (delete) and I flag any mail that looks interesting or that I
    should consider (defer). If I have a response right then I reply
    (do).
-   Every other day or so I go through the flagged mail and really spend
    time considering the responses and replying or doing something.
    Usually the email that makes it to this level is worth my time.

*Tasks:* We use Jira for development tasks which keeps things pretty
straight forward, anything else I throw into gQueues, detailed below.

**Calendar: **I hate meetings, avoid them at all costs, I know I have a
SCRUM and some other agile meetings, other than that I just use the
outlook calendar which syncs to the old phone. (Secretly I just let
anyone else remind me if I am not at a meeting.)

###Life Email and Snail Mail

I follow a similar process with all the other email I get:

*gMail:* I take serious advantage of gmail filters and use the
unsubscribe feature quite a bit. Each email I get is a chance to not get
it. Most email is auto archived and tagged with things like “Finance” or
“Amazon” and much is auto read and archived so I don’t even have to
worry about it. The rest I star for future follow up and archive the
rest. I try to keep zero items in my inbox (see [Inbox Zero](http://inboxzero.com/)) as much
as possible. Again every few days I clean out the stared email
with replies or actions.

*Snail Mail:* I absolutely love [https://www.mailboxforwarding.com](https://www.mailboxforwarding.com)
which let’s you set up an address and they scan all your mail for you. I
shred what I don’t want, forward things I need in hard copy (almost
nothing) and save the rest. They even deposit checks I might receive.

##Tying It All Together

As it stands right now I have quite a few to-do lists formed from
processing of emails, and to tie things together I
use [http://www.gqueues.com/](http://www.gqueues.com/) which is a great and flexible task
organizer, has a chrome plugin, google calendar sync and is not too complicated to use.

It is very quick to type "Go pick up the milk #groceries today" and it will parse the hash into a tag and the "today" into a due date.

Similarly with the plug in I can quickly save a website for later reading.

##In Conclusion
I hope some of these processes have given you tips on how you might improve your personal workflows and productivity. They are by no means the best solutions but have been honed over time to eliminate as much noise and urgency from my day-to-day work.

My personal opinion is that I have a few too many systems to manage and could certainly automate quite a bit more.
